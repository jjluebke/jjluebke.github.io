        <h1>Outreach | Filter Design</h1>

        <p>Outreach is a sales engagement platform, with features built on top of the customer’s CRM data, mostly concerning the opportunity object. This object is a list of all potential sales opportunities in an organization’s pipeline and can often be made up of hundreds of fields. I was tasked with describing, designing and ultimately building a portable and flexible filter-builder, handling very simple to very complex use cases, mostly targeting the customer’s opportunity object.</p>

        <p>The following are high-level takeaways, my comprehensive design document can be read in-full here:</p>

            <p>Most often, only a few filters may need to be applied to generate the desired result however a user may need to apply many filters using a combination of logical operators to achieve the desired result.

            <h3>Compact</h3>
            <p>By design, the number/size of filters is not limited and can become very complex. The design needs to allow for one to many filters and filter groups to be applied while still remaining readable.</p>

            <p>A user could combine filters in an illogical way that would allow for either ambiguity or guaranteed null results. In order to provide a good experience, the components must enforce certain rules by providing relevant feedback/errors, preforming actions on behalf of the user and hiding/showing options in a given situation.</p>

        <h2>Describing Patterns</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-r">
      <p>Where the existing opportunity filter used a subtractive approach, the final design uses an additive pattern to build the filter. These two types are depicted below:</p>

      <h3>Subtractive filtering pattern</h3>
      <p>This is a common pattern, typically when the content has a finite set of criteria on which to filter. For example many e-commerce sites utilize this type of filtering, where all options are listed and selecting one reduces the main result set. This is not ideal for a Commit customers as their data is driven by CRM which does not limit the number and type of data fields that can be defined.</p>

      <h3>Additive filtering pattern</h3>
      <p>This approach is to start with no parameters and add in only what is relevant. It renders a clean empty state that is less visually intimidating than presenting all the possible filters up-front. This pattern is less common among consumer and e-commerce sites, and more common in digital applications that interface with large data-sets, such as geographic, weather, documents and financial.</p>

      <h2>Design Iterations</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="col-r">
    <p>I created three designs to explore concepts, working with my product manager and UX team to gain feedback of what works and what doesn't. The designs are disucced in brief below.</p>

    <h3>Concept 1</h3>
    <p>This design does a good job at minimizing the complexity, albeit at the expense of readability. The consolidated filter condition removes too much information, requiring the user to click into the item to understand the full definition of the filter. Additionally, the portability of the filter conditions does not offer much in the way of clearly defining boolean grouping logic.</p>
      
    <h3>Concept 2</h3>
    <p>This design is clear and functional allowing flexibility and clarity, however, limits the amount of complexity a user can define. Filters are confined to group, located a static depth.While this would likely serve the needs of most users, the server-side model allows for infinite nesting of groups of filter definitions, which is realized in the next design iteration.</p>

    <h3>Concept 3</h3>
    <p>This approach extends the previous design by allowing for the creation of groups within groups. Indeed, the data structure can quickly become complex, but only as much as the user desires. The graphical group structure does well to demonstrate boolean relationships while serving as combiner user input.</p>

    <h2>Functional Prototype</h2>
</div>
<div class="col-r">
  <p>I created a functional prototype of the final design to test with users. The prototype was built using React and consumed static data. The prototype was used to catch any usability issues as well as to validade the generated object structure. Most of the React components were reused in the final deliverable.</p>

    <h2>Final Implementation</h2>
</div>
<div class="col-r">
  <p>After buliding the production version of this component, it was implemented in several disparate areas of the client/admin apps. The current version has undergone design iterations, however has served as a model for other filtering applications within the organization. The example below shows an implementation with a real-time data preview to validate filter results.</p>

          <p>The web interface was developed in parallel with the mobile app, both utilizing the API. The major difference between the two is how a user sorts through Bright Ideas. Instead of a seeming infinite feed, like Facebook or Instagram, we pursued a card stack concept, as the user may only have a handful of suggestions at any given moment.</p>
          <p>Another interesting concept was the input mechanism. For each service we were able to compile a formula to generate a finite price for the service processing a few input variables from the homeowner. Instead of a standard form, we used a Mad Lib. While this was arguably more verbose, it made the data collection feel more personal and fun.</p>

          <p>Initial concepts presented to willing participants for general concept feedback and rough interface development. Initially, the central idea was called a Bright Idea: a suggestion to preform some relevant task, how to do it, average difficulty, time needed, etc.  Some of the suggestions had the option to hire a professional, if we had the contract and pricing setup.</p>
          <p>Secondary functionality is a "Punchlist," or a to-do list automatically created by scheduling a service professional or from a Bright Idea. Items entered on the Punchlist are also a source for automated recommendations.</p>

Flows start with an input, provide the possible actions and outcomes, then define an exit point. With this defined, a server-side developer can begin to created the application API.</p>

          <p>The web interface was developed in parallel with the mobile app, both utilizing the API. The major difference between the two is how a user sorts through Bright Ideas. Instead of a seeming infinite feed, like Facebook or Instagram, we pursued a card stack concept, as the user may only have a handful of suggestions at any given moment.</p>
          <p>Another interesting concept was the input mechanism. For each service we were able to compile a formula to generate a finite price for the service processing a few input variables from the homeowner. Instead of a standard form, we used a Mad Lib. While this was arguably more verbose, it made the data collection feel more personal and fun.</p>
