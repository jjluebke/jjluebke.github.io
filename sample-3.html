                <dd>Sole front-end engineer for a new mobile app built on React Native for iOS, Android as well as a public and private web-based application. Built in colaboration with a single back-end engineer.</dd>

                <dt>Challenge:</dt>
                <dd>Provide an alternative to calling 911 for non-emergency situations and events. This reduces the pressure on both 911 call centers and first-responders (primarily police officers) alike.</dd>
            </dl>

            <h3>Summary:</h3>
            <p>Relay was a funded startup, based on a concept by a police chief, to have citizens use a mobile app (among other means) to report non-emergency issues directly to police, rather than contacting 911. The app allowed users to share their location, photos/videos a written description and issue type. The police agency had a "responder" app where the report would be received, based on a geo-fence of the reported issue. Police would be able to respond and address the concern, while the reporter would receive updates allong the way.</p>

            <p>The product was rolled out in more than 8 cities/police districts, some with more than 1 million residents. We came across some really interesting challenges, such a overlapping police jurisdictions, usage in schools, private events and what happens when a report is submitted outside of a coverage area.  After 2 years the product was growing in usage, however due to very long planning cycle for goverment budgets, we were unable to continue working on this concept.</p>

            <h3>Summary:</h3>
            <p>The use case is for customer service representives to trouble-shoot online applications, forms, webapps, etc. Broadly, this is achieved by parsing the DOM, drawing it into a HTML canvas element, rendering an image, then sending the image blob to the viewers.</p>
            <p>This was a fantastic challenge without any roadmap of ways to accomplish the end-goal. The concept was fairly simple, however playback quality and frame rate proved to be very challenging.</p>

                <h3>Summary:</h3>
                <p>Pigeon is a personal, public project focusing on making it easier to control and fly UAVs. Pigeon is an app that runs on a phone, replacing the need for propritary hardware and external sensors. Setup and control is all preformed through remote software and all communication is over TCP/IP.</p>

                <p>Pigeon is not yet airborne, however is very close. The video above depics a recent "bench" test, demonstrating compensation based on craft orientation. Unfortunately, evidence from these tests indicate that bluetooth communication from the phone to the motors is simply not fast enough to prevent oscillations in compensation.</p>
