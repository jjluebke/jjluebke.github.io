        <h1>An opportunity for improvement</h1>

        <p>Presented with a RFP to deploy an existing Flash application to a stand-alone kiosk, I saw an opportunity to create a better product fit for the overall intended goal. Transitions wanted to place the kiosks in the offices of eye care professionals to present them with an application called EyeGlass Guide. It is a short multiple choice quiz designed to help patients decide what glasses and options they might need. The client wanted to leverage existing tool, however I saw an opportunity to both improve the experience and modernize the aging application to allow for even greater potential of distribution and usage.</p>

            <h2>Understanding broader Stakeholder requirements</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-r">
            <p>The two major issues I saw with the original idea were those of patient experience and practicality.</p>

            <p>After completing the original RFP, I drafted and presented a project outline as an alternative to the requested project. Here are the main take-aways:
                <ul>
                    <li>Re-develop the Flash application to use HTML/Javascript</li>
                    <li>Package the new application into an iOS app</li>
                    <li>Purchase iPads in favor of single-purpose kiosks (cost-savings of 75% per device)</li>
                    <li>Once distributed, develop additional apps to deploy remotely, leveraging existing capital investment</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>A patient would be presented with the iPad at check-in to complete the quiz seated while waiting.</p>

            <p>The benefit for patient:
                <ul><li>A more private, comfortable experience</li></ul>
            </p>

            <p>Benefits for client:
                <ul>
                    <li>Smaller capital investment</li>
                    <li>Opportunity to utilize hardware in the future</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Benefit for our company:
                <ul><li>Larger project with increased likelihood for future work</li></ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Context of Use Analysis</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-r">
            <p>Before starting on design and development, I spent a day in the office of an eye care professional, observing how a patients interact with the staff and their physical environment. Data collection included who they spoke with, where they were within the office and for how long, average idle time and opportunity for engagement with the product.</p>
            <p>Take-aways:
                <ul>
                    <li>If patients are to complete the quiz within the average wait time, it needs to be short and efficient</li>
                    <li>Having a portable device allows the practice to be flexible in implementing</li>
                </ul></p>

            <p>In addition to these, a very useful feature was discovered. After completing the quiz, the patient often referenced the results. To facilitate this the results are automatically emailed to the practice, printed out and included in the patient's chart. Patients, stakeholders and eye care professionals really liked this addition.</p>

            <h2>Prototyping and Usability Testing</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-r">
            <p>Two high-fidelity interactive prototypes were made. The desktop version looked and behaved as a direct port from the existing Flash application. The mobile was completely re-designed for a touch interface and to make better use of the iPad's screen size and shape. Special consideration was given to contrast and size, given the end-user inherently has less than perfect vision. Both versions utilized a mocked API, as it was in development.</p>
            <p>User-testing was preformed with 12 participants from a recruiting company with criteria of age and glasses-wearers, among others. They were given tasks to preform on each interface, half using the iPad first and the other half using the desktop first. Participants were recorded preforming each task both on screen and on video for post-analysis. They completed SUS then had a structured, open-ended interview about their experiences.</p>
            <p>The main take-aways from user-testing:
            <ul>
                <li>Provide better instructions</li>
                <li>Improve interface responsiveness (feedback as a result of user action)</li>
                <li>Inform the user of length and their progress (status bar)</li>

        </div>
        <div class="col-r">
            <p>The client stakeholders distributed the application to the top 100 practices by their metrics, with some locations having multiple.  Usage measures included tracking by practice, quiz starts, completions and abandon rates. These numbers were used to compare sales within the practice, and indeed there was a positive correlation with quiz completions and sales.</p>
            <p>The quiz and hardware were incorporated into a subsequent project, a product education and reward program for eye care professionals. Part of the curriculum involved how best to utilize the EyeGlass Guide in-office. Additionally, completing enough modules allowed practices to receive an iPad preloaded with the quiz and other branded tools.</p>
